THe PM2.5 Data sets of 30 sensing devices deployed in Peking University over sixe months.

The data are provided by two ".csv" tables. "DataSet_1(20180301-20180515).csv" provides the PM2.5 data from March 1st 2018 to May 15th 2018. "DataSet_2(20180605-20180825).csv" provides the PM2.5 data from June 5th 2018 to Augest 25th 2018.

Each "csv" file is contains a table with 30 colomns and 10000+ rows. A row represents a specific sampling time, and a colomn represents a specifc sensing device deployed at a fixed location. Each cell contains a integer value indicating the concentration of the PM2.5 (in "ug/m3"). The time interval between adjacnt sampling is 10 minutes.
